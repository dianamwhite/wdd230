        <p>Alignment is a very important principle of Design because arranges the elements on a page so this one won't be a complete mess.
            The Alignment guides the audience in the direction that you want to send them. Without Alignment the elementsseem to have no sense of direction. It is also important to distract your audience as little as posible.

        </div>
        <p>Contrast is a very fundamental design priciple because creates a very strong focal point for the user and guides them to the areas with high visual interest.
            It helps organize your design and stablish a hierarchy. This will help to find the most important part of your design.
            Contrast can be through color, line, size, texture, etc.  </p>

        </div>
        <p>Space and Clean Design refers to white space, also known as negative space. This one is the empty space around the design content. The main purpouse of the white space is to let the user breath by reducing the many elements and just let the essential ones.
           This creates a clean space in the design.

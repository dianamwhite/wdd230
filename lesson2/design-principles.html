        We can see that The New York Times mobile website guides the audience through the news from the most newest important to the next stories. Everything is in one column and it guides 
        the user perfectily in a right direction and without been crowd of information but just the necessary.

            <a href="http://www.etsy.com">www.etsy.com</a><br>
            <img src="images/etsymobile.jpg" alt="etsy">
        </div>
        <p> Etsy mobile website is a great a example os Space and Clean Design. The empy space around the design content is moderate. It is not crowed of products and advertisement like other websites. 
            The main purpouse of the white space is to let the user breath  and Etsy by reducing the many elements and just let the essential ones created and organize and clean website that accomplish the purpouse.</p>

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <div id="box3">
            <h4>MUSEUM L'OLIO ELEVATO AD ARTE</h4>
            <a href="http://www.museum.it">www.museum.it</a><br>
            <img src="images/museummobilesite.jpg" alt="museum">
        </div>
        <p>
            The mobile browser of the Museum has a very nice contrast in the main image and color. This creates a very strong focal point for the user and guides them to the areas with high visual interest.
            It helps organize your design and stablish a hierarchy, in this case the is calling the user to try and see the new Olive in the Museum.
